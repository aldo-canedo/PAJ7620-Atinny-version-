@details This demo can recognize 9 gestures and output the result,
including move up, move down, move left, move right, move forward,
move backward, circle-clockwise, circle-counter clockwise, and wave.
This example uses an interrupt handler to dectect when a gesture has
occurred instead of polling for it.

@details This demo uses the @ref RevEng_PAJ7620::getWaveCount() "getWaveCount()" interface.
As you wave your hand in front of the sensor, it counts the quantity of passes you make,
 and the RevEng library exposes that value. This demo outputs that value and the wave event.

@brief Sets sensor into "cursor" mode to track an object in a (x,y) coordinate system.

@details This example shows off "cursor mode" of the sensor
    This mode outputs an (X,Y) pair when an object is in view.
    It is effectively a "mouse mode" or "pointer mode"
    The intended use would be a low res non-contact pointer for input
    It would make a really cool game interface!
    This demo also enables the LED_BUILTIN - 
     when a cursor is in view the LED lights up.

@details This demo demonstrates the ability to measure an object’s size and IR reflected brightness to the sensor. These APIs run in Gesture Mode. Size is in the range 0..900, which is the number of pixels reflecting IR back to the sensor within the 30x30 image array. “Brightness” is a scaled value of 0..255, but doesn’t seem to have any units documented.
